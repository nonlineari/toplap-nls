# Modular of End-User
## A Discourse on Modularity, Centralization, and the Architecture of Systems

---

## Opening: Night Work

All right, what I'm saying is I want to continue to talk to people who actually are not, you know, partying or something, not out drinking or something. Maybe people who are more at peace or really asleep or something. I've been working on this for 25, 60, 30 years, you know, even more, maybe. Nighttime. Night course, or night hawk, whatever you call it.

---

## Part I: The Cell Phone as Node

### Centralized Matter

Right, so the cell phone design is a centralized matter. It's a node, it's a network, it's perfectly secured as a node, because you don't lose a phone, but once you lose a phone—the phone leaves the pocket, the note disappeared, right? The note disappears. Just like if someone went into your house and took something, that particular object would not exist, right?

But if you believe more science fictional things, I still don't believe people are not willing to sacrifice over psycho loads of money, you know?

### The Voice Everywhere

So I believe that something might be realistic enough to actually hear these kind of voices everywhere, you know, like people are asking questions or insinuating questions for an answer, right? But that's not the problem because there are a lot of things that are—let's say, banking industrial, for example. Are they going to be doing things like centralized digitalized currency?

Because hardly we use currency in the way that we're already not using physical currency as much as we do, right?

---

## Part II: Three Markets

### Grey, Black, White

Perhaps what I'm saying is you can buy drugs with currency and you can buy drugs with digital currency. But a lot of people don't have the means to understand what is on the chain or what is digitally designed to buy things—you're going to be tracing. You have the underground woman to continue thriving, like the black market, the grey market, and the white market, for example.

### Art Movement Question

Are we going to be plateaued a thousand times and say these things actually make sense because do we want to continue to exist in this world with no movement at all? Have there been the art movement in the last 20 years? No, I don't think even more than 20 years. There's something new come up with art movement. Perhaps technology movement. Are we still on the art type of things?

Are we going to be thinking like a Thievery Corporation?

---

## Part III: Thievery Corporation & Independent Music

### 18th Street Records, Washington D.C.

Perhaps in Hong Kong, there's no one who listened to them. 18th Street records from Washington, D.C. These guys are made to be known for making jazzy, kind of funky, electronic music. Thievery Corporation is one of the best known independent music scene in the world, but these—the only for a few people who are actually out of this, let's surround in a circle of people, they are just a handful of them who listens to these music.

Because most people don't have reasons to actually look for music in the first place, especially places I've been living in, I've not always have people who understand what music I enjoy listening to or what the music was making. So it doesn't matter who it is. It's just the record label is the most famous record label in the world.

Will you believe me?

---

## Part IV: Telepathic Pressure

### ESP Wavelength

But then, again, for people who actually have all these questions, putting pressure on people, asking like, let's get some money tonight. Let's make some money and something like that. But I'm not just thinking about money because all night I've been being asked, like, you know, telepathically, ESP, kind of thing. Like the wavelength of brain structure is so chemical physics of our cells, right?

So I used to don't just rely on just two arms and two legs.

### Arrested Development?

Okay, so if this thought comes through, should I be doing the arrested development on the people who took the money? Because you is my kind of this escort, you know? And then there was this dealer from Australia who actually used to be working Vietnamese. But I'm not going to name names, right? Because it's not important that I think at the end I will give you some of these acquaintance names.

But the problem is not about being stooled, right?

---

## Part V: Solid State Society

### Network → Solid State

But I just want to continue saying the centralization of the cell phone is importantly designed as an achievement in the architecture of the network system. The solid state actually continued because before that it was just network internet and then networks network system, right? And then it would turn to solid state system due to the fact that personally, I think.

### Ghost in the Shell Reference

I should go see that again, that manga or that animation called Ghost in the Shell, because they really touched the point where terrorism, anti-terrorism and these activities of action-packed crime driven enemy or people actually were referring to the solid state society, right?

So let's say a hacker was in the solid state or he said, well, the society, right, in that robot, right? He doesn't seem like the cell phone was really using much because at that time when they made that TV show, the cell phone was not a smartphone or it wasn't a touch screen. So you have no least instruments built into the cell phone. And so the cell phone actually becomes a more compact system of design. And the architecture becomes more sophisticated.

---

## Part VI: Robin Hood & Satoshi

### Is Satoshi Robin Hood?

And you want questions about teams of people, like tribal people. That's not the question I'm hosting because you still think about, okay, if this conversation will help you to create money, then should we just ask Robin Hood to hand the money out? Is that a myth or something, right?

So who is Robin Hood then? Right? The question is, is that a notation within the system or within the society that we built all along these years that, well, Satoshi Nakamoto, right?

He's not Robin Hood. He's just an architect, but understood what he was doing at the time. And then there was all these other people who built these programs, structure or the coding of the programming through AI and stuff like the evolution of AI.

### The Node Question

But where is the node of this system designer and the architectural system or the notation of the node in the society of the solid state? So are we having ghosts in the shell, like in the cell?

But perhaps I'm talking more likely rambling onto robot TV shows about hackers who actually don't use a smartphone. How can they travel and go find and scan Bluetooth and scan WiFi without a smartphone? Or how do they get online? All these things.

---

## Part VII: The Trillion Dollar Question

### Who's Going to Kill the Guy?

I don't know. Let's say, how are you going to transfer money to dealers and buy shampoo, for example, buy a hamburger or something at some burger joint, right? So the problem of society, are we leaving solid state right now? And this is a question that we leave both the $1 trillion dollars, who's going to kill the guy with $1 trillion? You know what I mean?

### Berkeley & Independent Labels

And I suppose, the Berkeley company these days are struggling to understand the solid state and the blockchain, right? The system of Web 3. But because they have lack of tenets or lack of engineers, or even independent record label—it's not because independent record label, can they not afford engineers and software designers and an artist and all these other things comes into play with the work they do?

Right, so ghostly, right, let's go back to the West Coast Independent Records in America. Thievery Corporation was 18th Street. You're gonna look it up, I think it's 18th Street.

---

## Part VIII: Cultural Revolution & One Country Two Systems

### Opening the Door

Then I was thinking, I should talk about cell phone centralization, decentralization, digital currency, because this is what the point is, because it's all about getting someone's dig the work for you. And of course, I'm not going to come back and say record label beggars banquet, right?

Because no one understood what these terminology, these notions are stamped into our memories and what we are used for in the underground music scene. And then there's all these other criteria before the opening of the China, right, for example, the Cultural Revolution after Cultural Revolution, they got rid of the communists and they opened up the door and said, okay, let's come in and we'll do business. This is basically what happened.

### Hong Kong Territory

And the other design is actually what this territory, this asset we have, this properties of assets within Hong Kong, within the territory of three, 34, of kilometers squares of land, it's a territory and this is a point I'm making is the one country two systems. But I'm not going to geopoliticalize this reason of talking about digital currency because everyone wants to talk about digital currency these days. It's like, how were we going to address these digital currency to escape the banal and the expense of bankruptcy or something, for corporations or even for the ledger in companies, independent company.

---

## Part IX: AI's First Recording

### Default Clock: January 1st

So the first time I gone AI is very simply made, I have one play that actually was record recording of a voice, right? But it said exactly what it said is the date and time stamped were actually back to default at the time when this clock was started. I think January 1st, right? So that was the digital clock when it first started on the first day of the year.

### Supply Chain

Well, so a record label is selling music to people on the cell phone. Are we actually not able to make the amount of revenue because we had to sell them a cell phone as well probably, right? So it's like you still have a CD, but you don't sell a CD player, what would that do? So we had to rely on this supply chain, right? It's always about supply chain.

---

## Part X: CD Scratching & AI Scratching

### The Disc Metaphor

I'm not the expert in scratching CD or something. But remember when CD—I'm rambling, but the CD is actually the point. I'm not really online, played work of CD scratching, because AI do have a scratch too, because they seem like when they're playing a track in your music library, not anywhere in your computer that was networked in the solid state. And that's the point, because AI still has a domain system. They rely on this domain network of systems, packet and pack it up, right? So because it's binaries still.

### Binary Continues

Right? So this goes on and on and on, but we go back to January first for the recording. There was no recording empty. So replacing that, the second search or second questions of discussion between me and my prompt of AI and X.AI is that do we understand the concept in organization from work and playing?

Last question is, last question. Right? So I think I'll leave it at that for now and I get back to it, because there's no end to this continuously.

---

## Part XI: Surface Sound Sector

### Record Labels Are Surface

And then the CD player were scratched by what kind of instrument. It was manually, you can scratch the disc, right? But while it's in rotation, the CD will scratch due to scratches on the surface. Right. So record label is actually mostly surface sound sector.

### No New Movements

And we don't really understand, if the likes of independent records and electronic and all these other underground music, I'm not going to go put it into it about the genre music, but there's no new movements between music or other music or actually music between, let's say, MTV visuals and all these other development content and film, right?

### Six Centimeters Square

So let's say we're living in a world that we only look at these two centimeters, six centimeters, squares to look at these blockbuster film or MTV systems. Do we delegate ourselves and negotiate our better movement in terms of are we inventing the wheel? Are we living in a world that we have no resolution left and our pixels only can last for 10 minutes, for example, all right?

---

## Part XII: Wasteland of Knowing

### Supply and Demand

So these things are like, we have to understand, I'm going through these moments of the existence of nowhere of knowing, no return of knowing, wasteland or something, because the idea is we all have supplies and demand curves. The chart is supply and demands. We want to run businesses, for some people. We want to understand how we can give money to people to actually invest in their ideas. Also, that's the important concept for what is 21st century will style up in the network system.

### Democratized Instruments

So is robot and making films and making movies and making music need investments? Or is it these democratized instruments are just always going to be in the node into a device, into a built-in device built out, and then you can draw out the content while you repetitively typing into the prompt to tell what you want to hear and listen to. Right, right, immediately, pretty much, there it would just bring you immediate feedback. And then you can have, whether you criticize it or you actually likes it or you actually enjoy it and you just go into the mode of trance.

---

## Part XIII: Ghost in the Machine

### Network State vs. Solid State Society

Right? So indeed is the network state and the solid state society. Are they actually working towards what we believe in, or are they the one who actually want to f*** up the society? So this goes like a ghost in the shell, right? So if the instruments is the ghost inside the machine, then where is society existed of these communities or these groups of tribes or whatever?

### Criminals & Time

Like these wasteland or the gangland members or all these things, like criminals, whatever. Are they involved insolvent into memberships and areas of lives and livelihood of everybody when they don't have means to think about that for themselves because they don't have the time or the money or actually don't even have the time to actually go through with knowing or seeing things that existed before.

---

## Part XIV: Discworld

### The Disc World

So let's say if the culture flattens again in the surface, how are going to be able to play this disc, the disc world, right? This science fiction book about the disc world, right? You know, like a CD is a disc rotating disc. Right, so why is AI scratching digital streaming platform at all?

### DJ Scratching the World

So, indeed, why are writing, typing, and all these physical structure that we've built to enhance the digital culture in digital architecture is being multiplied and scratching, like let's say, like a DJ scratching on piece of music, achieving harmony or something, right?

So there must be some reason that these scratches exist on the surface of a disk. So the world is being scratched as a piece of music, so enhanced music, as harmonic systems of design. But is that only music that gets scratched?

### Connectivity

I think not. And it is connectivity. It has to be connectivity. So society of connections or society, a system of connections or connectivity, society—society, could be, but, you know, I don't think that name or term makes just this whole concept brightens and makes it all in the distribute the system.

---

## Part XV: Centralized Gravity & Surfing

### Next 100 Years

What if we produce things that are differently from now to the next 100 years. And we're not tracking ourselves, but we're centralizing ourselves. We're within the decentralization of the world. So we pull out centralized gravity, like we go surfing, right? We gravitate into the waves and we drop in.

### Goods and Cons

So that's the reason that I think having a mobile device that does all these things also has the goods and the cons, the pros and cons of things that we don't really want it to be, knowing that we have no privacies, but what is the world are we negotiating for privacies?

### Dialogue with Machines

Because if we are connected, we should be in dialogue between ourselves and machines. So, are we free in the connectivity that we have with machines? Are we not negotiating, not discussing, not communicating between ourselves, like we have machines that lives with us.

---

## Part XVI: Physical Infrastructure

### Fiber Optics in the Ground

Between the physical network and, let's say, WiFi brand and fiber optics, right? Little physical things lays inside our grounds. Are we actually repeating this mistake of physically employing a deploying node in physical structure. So we do have landmarks and all these things, but culturally, we will need something more connected towards the world that we know it exists.

### The Unknown Known

And yet we don't really know it exists, because we don't see it in front of us, because we don't want to be bluffing about things that we don't have yet connected or we don't have the means to understand them themselves, like the architecture of systems, right?

---

## Part XVII: Solar System & Void

### Beyond the System

So by moving on forward, this is what I want to give an answer to is that it would leave the system. The next thing we know is the universe or something, right? So the solar system, right? Because solar system. But we can devoid and say everything is just a void and we just don't know the black hole or is a void or is a wormhole or something like physically structure the magnet is a global projection of some kind.

### Time Travel

Basically, we can change the time of the projected world. I'm sure people can travel around, you know, easily within timing systems and systems of navigations and all these things, our system of some kind of built structure around us.

---

## Part XVIII: Temples & Modularity

### Latitude & Podcast

So iconically, when I visited all these temples around different parts of certain parts of the world in the latitude, the podcast we have is like we can continue on to theologize and monopolize on these cell phones, but the PVP is in a sense, like only attacking one reasons of reasoning, because non-reasons do not exist in the world that why are we still not understanding the modularity inside the cell phone, for example?

### How We Modularize It

How we modularize it? Because it's own software bases are programmatically designed for system architects, or engineered to be electronically enhanced in a digital culture that only use softwares to enhance a modularity between physical computing and humans discussions that you can have.

### Le Corbusier & Modularity

But if that continues to say, modularity, what is modularity? Le Corbusier was the architect to do it. In, let's say, I don't know, South Africa was big on some kind of movement, you know, between race of people, the colonialists. Colonial time, colonialists was a movement. You can take my word for that, because their movement, their modulars, the modulari, armies and audiences these other boats and ships and sinkers and empires.

The empire was a modular design fighting machine. War machine, right?

---

## Part XIX: Open Source vs. Non-Privacy

### Opposite Meanings

So is our centralization of non-privacies and open market, open data, or even open source is different opposite with the meaning. There's like those who don't use this my language, I'm talking to regulate in this part of the world. Asia don't use English as a de facto language to communicate between countries. Neither do South America. Only the Western world, the more liberal, open, kind of west, right?

### Multicultural Solar System

So if the world is a science fiction of multicultural building structure within the solar system on this planet, then a modularity of explanation is actually is not geography. It's not geopolitics now. It has to be physical continuance, let's say massive built worshipping space and relics, like the pyramids, which I will plan to go to see the pyramids.

### Teotihuacan, Angkor Wat

But like, let's say Teotihuacan, for example, in Mexico, Angkor Wat, all these other places—huge stone temple, right? We don't know if this is actually a conceptualized world that we actually remain physically attached to our world. But we have ignored them for many years. I'm sorry, but these are things that we ignored for years and years, but we have no architecturally enhance our collective memories or our even intellectual memories.

---

## Part XX: AI's Thoughts = Our Thoughts

### Looking at Truth

So what AI have thoughts is the same as what we have thinking about. Just no one actually wanted to look at the truth sometimes, but. Right. So the modular design in these temples, similar to, let's say, bigger structure of architecture and design, but they are more like a physical computing structure as in a piece of architecture.

### Cocaine Intake?

I mean, you can criticize my own intake of, let's say, cocaine, for example, right? Are they modular? I don't know, but I'm not a scientific discussion of leaving the world right now to say disconnections of intake of drug or these music design people I intend to manipulate the normal people, right?

### Normal Humans

But you got to say to these people, are they really normal in sense of their mentally attached brain? Are they using the brain power to actually discuss with people like normal humans with enhanced technology in the physical computing and all these other places in the world.

---

## Part XXI: Satoshi Speaks

### Decentralized When Not Designed Decentralization

So let's say decentralized when not designed decentralization. And Satoshi Nakamoto, for example, I don't admit I have $1 trillion or $10 trillion dollars. I don't even count what is going on, right? But the fact is, Satoshi has explained to everybody where presently I'm talking, right?

### Social Engineering

So I'm not admitting who is designed this character. Maybe I was social engineered into doing that but yes, the name was given because it's not just normal. It's a combination of words in Japanese that I thought these people relate to me and they have relationships that needs to be clarified. It's something that we don't have time to remember or we don't have time to retrieve these information out of my brain.

---

## Part XXII: Modular Design of the Cell Phone

### The Module

So let's say, let's go back to this note of cell phone design. So a cell phone is it's a module of design, right? So it should be parts that we understand these are things to put together. They do put together, in fact. The matter is, why are we not actually thinking the units that we're building in the world has also has a very economics that we continue to build.

### 30 Minutes

But how this economics understand by a 30 minute discussion? We cannot understand this modularity of architecture and system design in 30 minutes.

**Right, so I'm going to stop there tonight.**
