# Satoshi Dreams Nakamoto
## A Film Concept

## Opening Monologue

Well, I have imagined someone being able to find the login details on the wallet, which is in 2009, I think, that it was just a link of an email wall. So now the one Bitcoin in that wallet have no idea where it was, and I don't really care, like, someone actually came up and took everything in there apartment and tried to open the wallet.

I'd really, it was quite the vault, but there's no way to be sure if they could. They probably could, but there was so much, like, nowadays, it's like one million because what like, a trillion. So someone, a group of these gangsters or thugs gonna get like a trillion dollar American. So they could actually save America for one day, but that's really not the point I'm making here.

## Act I: The Lost Wallet

### Scene: The Open Terminal

I wouldn't know where all these money went anyway, so I would not bother talking about Satoshi Nakamoto's life or whatever it is. But indeed, there's an open terminal of these operating systems in my computer - completely open after like 40 years of usage. Why would that PC be completely covered and stored away?

So by all means, I have no idea if this open source terminal inside the network system before the solid state system existed is like, this is actually my program to talk about. Not actually getting danger of like, a systematical—Ghost in the Shell, Ghost in the Shell Part One, you know. The part Ghost in the Shell was in Hong Kong. Section 9 were anti-terrorist organization.

### Philosophical Question #1: Money & Crime

So if we can use a lot of money to tackle some crime or make some money to make more money—but two sides of the coin. Once you have a lot of money, what would you do with it? I don't even think about these things because I can't afford to think about these things.

## Act II: Structural Architecture

### Scene: The Company, The Work

What I think about is structural architecture within what I'm working on now in the company. You have the work you have to do. Let's say if you're hiring writers and you're hiring musicians, you still have to perform that music, right? Or nowadays you can actually program that music.

### The AI Transformation

They're so rare—if we look at the porn industry in these companies, like Candy AI. The AI is actually so realistic that you don't even need the camera and set up lighting and get the wardrobe out there. You can do everything within the scope of just writing what you want to have in the scene. That's the most fundamental thing you have to do.

And then you have to think about: How much does it cost to actually market that? You have to market it, right?

### Open Source to Commercial

So when OpenAI were going to become commercial, why from open to commercial has so much lies behind these open source culture. It's the same way—if my network, my terminal is widely open, I would say things right now to everybody.

## Act III: The Terminal Speaks

### Scene: Universal Basic Income Fantasy

If I would give everyone the amount of money they needed or like wrestled their lives—do you know how much you need to do that just for the sake of life? Whether you take the money, you do crime or you go buy a house or you do whatever you like, go travel the world.

Don't imprison your thinking into fabrications of some kind. Imagine like the world is actually this and that and how it did happen or did not happen. But I'm not saying disinformation or fake bakery—like what Orson Welles was doing.

I could talk to you people about this every day. After like five, ten minutes, I can go on for like half an hour, two hours, one hour. But in fact, I'm not talking between your legs. I'm saying things because these things can be said in another way around.

### The Real Numbers

Maybe that was not a one trillion, maybe the coins was only like 100, wasn't a million coins. So I don't know—you gotta think about, okay, if proceeding Robinhood, if this invested money is going to be taken out from the foundation of the crypto world.

## Act IV: Who Is This Guy?

### Scene: The Question of Identity

I mean, are we going to start talking about who is this guy talking about Satoshi Nakamoto right today? Because there's nobody right now. There's no one existing in the world with one trillion dollars in his pocket.

### Personal Crisis

And indeed, in fact, I might have to move back to the house, to the apartment because I might be in divorce court, I might have nowhere to live or maybe there's no way I can afford to move to a different apartment.

But why can I talk so fluently like this suddenly? But I can sit here kind of entrenched by all means, looking at my phone, looking at the central units, thinking about decentralization. Only because everyone's asking me questions.

### The Obligation to Answer

And I'm trying to answer everybody's question. But you might be pissed off for many reasons because I'm not catered, I'm not motivated, or I might not be actually even with decency to actually pay someone back with the money for some services or some goods or for some products or whatever it is.

## Act V: Time & Communication

### Scene: Talking to Everyone, Everywhere, Everywhen

I'm not broke deep into this philosophical things, but I do have thoughts about how I can talk to you, everybody at the same time, everywhere, and every now and then, even in the past or in the future, or right now presently.

### Philosophical Question #2: Centralization

Do you think this online system is actually better off using a phone centralization, like the master and slave relationship? Should we actually continue using cell phones? That's my question of the day, because this is the most important thing I have to think about.

### The Present Moment

Even I'm not capturing my thoughts everywhere else, but to you, I would think like these days is the present time now, right here, this year. I would rather be in the rave, dancing my ass off, listening to good music.

People are raving now, and I have to talk to someone about my arrangements, for example, if I want to see a woman or I don't want to see a woman.

## Act VI: The Collective Dream

### Scene: One Million Dreamers

But the other thing is we are designed to factorize information. So I think the idea is like everyone's thinking about Satoshi Nakamoto. Imagine 110,000 people or a million more people are looking at the crypto account and saying, "Well, if they have the same plot..." and said the thought is, if I had that amount, but you know, let's do the thing.

### Decentralization Problem

And those are not the centralization problem. That's why we have to figure out: a body of governments. If we designed something around decentralization pool of government, is that possibly actually happening for humans to actually understand?

### The Tracking Device

They are carrying a device—they're tracking device—and everyone's trying to hack into the tracking device. Groups of organizations pinpoint like this and this and this, information that's missing, memory liquidated, or perhaps the whole world is actually looking at the datascape or the database.

---

## Act VII: The Database Question

### Scene: 1970

What is database? What about database from 1970 or something? If 1970 was the January 1st, was the first time this recording was made. Would you believe this is 1970?

### The Multiverse Problem

The fact is, we do not have the understanding of how we multiply and multiply—design the multiverse, for example, even like Marvel Comics. We want to keep the peaceful, the nice things in talking about it.

### End-User Philosophy

But the problem that we have—we can see, talk about the end-user. Is the point of view today: is the end-user going to be continued using their own properties and their own product to continue actually communications, communicating between the deep web or the normal web or the normal people? The dark web also was slightly deeper than the dark web, the deep web.

## Closing Scene: Let My People Go Surfing

I don't know, because I don't think people are not just leaving their home to actually go surfing.

**So you should let my people go surfing. That's what I'm saying.**
